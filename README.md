Repository for EV228 EDS. Theo & David.

**Summary:**

This project is analyzing the 2025 Flooding in Beijing by looking at precipitation data from 1951-2025 from Beijing, Chengde, and Shijiazhuang.

**Process to generate figures:**

For the figure of daily average with 2025 precipitation data you use the avg_precip.py and EDS_functions.py code. The function to import the data, calculate a mean and plot a graph is defined in avg_precip.py and is called daily_avg. To then run this function EDS_functions demonstrates how you can import the module and call the function with the file path of the data, file output, and name of graph being defined.

**Code Index:**

yearly_precip_theo.py - defines yearly_avg function that imports time series data, creates a yearly average, and plots a graph.
avg_precip.py - defines daily_avg function that imports time series data, ceates a day-of-year average, and plots a graph.
EDS_functions.py - this code calls the two functions defined above and is an example of how to run the functions to generate graphs from data.
